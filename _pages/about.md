My research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical linguistics, formal languages and automata theory, and current advances in NLP. Specifically, I leverage formal languages to study the Transformer's expressiveness and inductive biases.

Previously, I received my MS in Computational Linguistics from University of Washington, where I worked with [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/shane-steinert-threlkeld) in the [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st) lab. I received my BA in Linguistics & Computer Science from UCLA.
